# Session Handoff

Status: Living

Restart instructions and compact current context. `progress.md` is the status
source of truth; `roadmap.md` is milestone order.

## Start here each session

1. Confirm repo:
   ```sh
   cd /Users/craig/git/loom
   git status --short
   ```
2. Read `.docs/spec/README.md`, then `.docs/status/progress.md` and this file.

## Where things stand

- **M1 is complete.** The loom plugin under `plugins/loom/` is built, installed,
  validated, and **run end-to-end**: command surface is split into namespaced
  `/loom:<name>` commands; agents are `loom:<role>`; the full slice loop works
  (planner → blind plan-eval → developer+gate → blind code-eval → finalize/archive).
- **M2 slice 1 landed (5fef2ed).** Init-mode detection is now single-sourced in
  `plugins/loom/skills/loom-playbook/references/init-detection.md` — concrete
  classifier with defined "loom-shaped" and "empty/near-empty" tests; four call
  sites repointed. Both plan and code evals: PASS (blind, independent).
- **M2 slice 2 landed (a58ff7e).** Greenfield init behavior is now single-sourced in
  `plugins/loom/skills/loom-playbook/references/greenfield.md` — concrete ordered
  steps: scaffold `.docs/`, seed `status/`, write project `CLAUDE.md`, establish
  the gate, commit + hand back. Three call sites (`orchestration.md`, `run.md`,
  `init.md`) repointed at it. Both plan and code evals: PASS (blind, independent;
  one MINOR on status file seeding — non-blocking). Deferred follow-up slices:
  unaligned-init-behavior, initialized-init-behavior, gate-learning.
- **`author-identity-enforcement-guard` landed (a47bf95).** PreToolUse hook
  (`plugins/loom/hooks/hooks.json` + `git-identity-guard.sh`) and hardened
  `commit-convention.md` now block all identity-override paths (`--author=`,
  `-c user.*`, `GIT_AUTHOR_*`/`GIT_COMMITTER_*`). 26-case acceptance matrix
  passed; jq-absent grep-fallback verified; code-eval Round 4 PASS (independent
  re-verification). Slice archived. The commit-identity guard gap follow-up is
  resolved. One new Open item: `--author` detection is not scoped to
  commit-creating subcommands, so read-only commands like `git log --author=` are
  also blocked — a usability refinement candidate for a future slice.
- **`retire-code-review-status-token` landed (a85885f).** The obsolete `Code Review`
  status token removed repo-wide from `SKILL.md`, `status-machine.md`,
  `developer.md`, and the slice-plans README `Lifecycle:` string. All lifecycle
  strings now match spec 03: `… → Implemented → (code review) → Landed → Archived`.
  Slice archived.
- **`recommended-tooling-and-mechanical-checks` landed (db39d44).** New
  `plugins/loom/skills/loom-playbook/references/tooling.md` (recommended CLI/LSP
  toolkit by role, all optional with fallback). "Invariants verified mechanically"
  rule added to both eval rubrics (`plan-eval-rubric.md`, `code-eval-rubric.md`);
  cross-links in `SKILL.md` and three agent files. Root cause of prior eval misses
  (eyeballing invariants) is now addressed. Slice archived.
- **Published:** GitHub repo `craigeous/loom` (public), default branch `main`.
- **All ten content specs (00–08, 10) are `Status: Approved`** after a retroactive
  blind plan-eval pass (eval records in `.docs/evaluations/spec-*-eval.md`). Several
  FAILed round 1 and were fixed (00/01/02/03/10) — see `progress.md` for the
  findings. Spec `09-open-questions.md` and the spec `README.md` are now
  `Status: Living` (09 is a live OQ tracker; README is the index).
- Design + decisions stable in `.docs/spec/` (00–10) and `.docs/ADR/` (0001–0006).
- **Deferred follow-ups from the spec pass** (in `progress.md` Open, for a future
  slice / owner decision): bare `/loom` in ADR 0001 needs a superseding ADR or
  erratum (ADRs are immutable — no rewrite). ~~The "Code Review" phase-label string~~
  is **resolved** (commit a85885f — token retired repo-wide). ~~The commit-identity
  guard gap~~ is **resolved** (commit a47bf95 — hook + doc hardening).
  ~~Eval-miss root cause (eyeballing invariants)~~ is **resolved** (commit db39d44 —
  mechanical-check rule in both rubrics + `tooling.md`).
- **Open items:** (a) spec-10 line-107 bare-`/loom` — frozen-spec planner cycle
  required; (b) guard `--author` not scoped to commit-creating subcommands — MINOR
  usability refinement, owner decision.

## Immediate next steps

1. **M2 slice 3 — Unaligned back-fill:** study the repo, scaffold (reusing
   `references/greenfield.md` as the scaffold foundation), then author descriptive
   `spec/` back-fill mapping what the project currently is (spec `06 §2`). This is
   the natural next M2 slice — Greenfield provides the scaffold primitive; Unaligned
   adds the descriptive layer on top.
2. **Remaining M2 follow-ups (after Unaligned):** Initialized resume menu (spec
   `06 §3`, slice "initialized-init-behavior") and gate-learning for unknown stacks
   (slice "gate-learning").
3. **Spec-10 line-107 bare-`/loom` fix:** spec 10 still contains a bare `/loom`
   reference at line 107. This is a frozen-spec planner cycle (propose an amendment,
   plan-eval, amend via planning — not a direct edit). The mechanical-check rule now
   in the rubrics ensures this kind of miss is caught earlier in future reviews.
4. **Guard `--author` subcommand-scoping refinement (MINOR):** the guard's
   `--author` ERE fires on read-only commands like `git log --author=` as well as
   commit-creating ones. Usability refinement candidate (not a security issue) —
   owner decision on whether to scope or accept current over-blocking.
5. **Deferred follow-up slices:** `gates/shell.md` (verified shell gate with
   `shellcheck` as the lint step — a clean follow-up when a shell-stack project is
   first encountered; `shellcheck` already pointed from `tooling.md`).
6. **M3 — parallelism:** worktree-per-slice + background agents (research note
   `2026-06-08-git-worktree-parallel-slices.md` is ready input; resolve OQ-A —
   owner guidance: the **planner** owns the `.docs/` coordination design).

## Notes for the next agent

- Commits are **author-neutral** AND under a **single uniform git identity** —
  roles must not set/override `user.*` (commit-convention; learned from the M1
  first run, where an agent strayed to `loom@localhost`).
- Command surface is `/loom:run` + one-off `/loom:<role>`; agents spawn via Task
  `subagent_type: loom:<role>` (verified).
