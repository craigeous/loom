# Slice Plans

Transient working memory: plans for **in-flight slices** before they land. Authored
by the **planner**, approved by the **plan evaluator** (or owner), implemented by
the **developer**, reviewed by the **code evaluator**.

A **slice** is a small, single-purpose, vertically-shippable unit of work. If a
plan grows multiple unrelated goals, split it.

Plans **propose**; specs **decide**. On any conflict, the spec in `../spec/` wins.
When a slice lands, its outcomes are folded into the durable specs and the plan is
`git mv`'d into [`archive/`](archive/) — **after** code-eval PASS, in the same
landing step.

Lifecycle: `Draft → Plan Review → Approved → In Progress → Implemented → Code
Review → Landed → Archived` (see
[../spec/03-artifact-lifecycle.md](../spec/03-artifact-lifecycle.md)).
