# Slice Plans

Transient working memory: plans for **in-flight slices** before they land. Authored
by the **planner**, approved by the **plan evaluator** (or owner), implemented by
the **developer**, reviewed by the **code evaluator**.

A **slice** is a small, single-purpose, vertically-shippable unit of work. If a
plan grows multiple unrelated goals, split it.

Plans **propose**; specs **decide**. On any conflict, the spec in `../spec/` wins.
When a slice lands, its outcomes are folded into the durable specs and the plan is
`git mv`'d into [`archive/`](archive/) — **after** code-eval PASS, in the same
landing step.

Lifecycle: `Draft → Plan Review → Approved → In Progress → Implemented → (code review) → Landed → Archived` (see
[../spec/03-artifact-lifecycle.md](../spec/03-artifact-lifecycle.md)).

## Active plans

- [unaligned-bare-migrate-split-plan.md](unaligned-bare-migrate-split-plan.md) — `Plan Review` —
  slice 3 of 3 (final) of the ADR-0009 Unaligned bare/migrate split: restructure
  `references/unaligned.md` into two sub-mode flows routed by the slice-1
  sub-classification — **Unaligned-bare** (the existing Steps 1–5: study →
  scaffold+gate via Greenfield → descriptive back-fill → seed status → hand back,
  scoped to "no pre-existing docs spine"; bare-only Draft→review rule preserved) and
  the new **Unaligned-migrate** flow (owner gate migrate/thin-pointer/abort with
  consequences; inline recipe via `migration-recipe.md`; status preservation; no
  planner/evaluator role-spawn). Authority line updated to spec 06 §2a/§2b; points at
  ADR 0009 §3/§4/§6, `init-detection.md`, `migration-recipe.md`; recipe mechanics and
  gate/status policy single-sourced (not restated). Implement touches `unaligned.md`
  + `SKILL.md` (the References description) — no spec/ADR/recipe/detection or CLAUDE.md
  edits at implement (CLAUDE.md curated-digest update is finalize-only). Target spec
  06-init-modes.md.

## Archived plans

- [archive/migration-recipe-reference-plan.md](archive/migration-recipe-reference-plan.md) — `Archived` —
  slice 2 of 3 of the ADR-0009 Unaligned bare/migrate split: new playbook reference
  `references/migration-recipe.md` — the reusable, ordered, idempotent Unaligned-migrate
  recipe (ADR 0009 §5/§7): preconditions (dirty-tree check, untracked-file handling,
  NUL-delimited lists), the numbered-spine → `spec/` + `status/` split with
  two-directional link rewrite, specific-before-generic ordering, idempotency via
  negative lookbehind `(?<!\.)` against the `..docs/` self-match, the three reference
  forms handled separately, the living-rewritten vs archived-snapshot boundary,
  status-preservation pointer (spec 06 §2b / ADR 0009 §4), and final link validation;
  plus a `SKILL.md` References entry. Landed a34d726/da21d2c/fdbbb60.

- [archive/init-detection-spine-signal-plan.md](archive/init-detection-spine-signal-plan.md) — `Archived` —
  slice 1 of 3 of the ADR-0009 Unaligned bare/migrate split: added the
  existing-but-undotted **docs-spine detection signal** to `init-detection.md` —
  concrete "pre-existing docs spine" definition, Unaligned sub-classification
  (spine present → Unaligned-migrate, else Unaligned-bare), updated dispatch table
  (§2a/§2b), read-only invariant preserved. `init-detection.md` only; no spec/ADR/
  `unaligned.md`/recipe edits. Target spec 06-init-modes.md. Landed c96fd90.

- [archive/claude-md-autopropagation-conformance-plan.md](archive/claude-md-autopropagation-conformance-plan.md) — `Archived` —
  bring the playbook implementation into conformance with the Approved `CLAUDE.md`
  auto-propagation spec amendment (Cycle 2): developer finalize pass now maintains
  `CLAUDE.md` as a curated digest (spec 03 step 2; boundary in spec 08); five playbook
  files updated to point to spec 08; single-sourced boundary. Completes the CLAUDE.md
  auto-propagation thread (Cycle 1: spec; Cycle 2: playbook). Landed b661f7a.

- [archive/identity-verification-hardening-plan.md](archive/identity-verification-hardening-plan.md) — `Archived` —
  close two structural gaps that let agents commit under a forged/fallback identity: Fix A —
  Greenfield "Ensure a git identity is configured" step (establish-or-stop; Unaligned/Initialized
  reference it verify-only) makes commit-convention's "init ensures an identity" claim true;
  Fix B — single-sourced "Verify after committing" sub-point in `commit-convention.md`
  (`git show -s --format='%an <%ae>'` + conditional `--amend --reset-author`) pointed at by
  all five agent prompts. No spec/ADR/hook edits; no hardcoded identity. Addresses the
  recurring `loom@localhost` M4 finding (code-eval PASS round 0; landed a816979).

- [archive/round-limit-conformance-plan.md](archive/round-limit-conformance-plan.md) — `Archived` —
  bring the playbook's round-limit text + both evaluator prompts into conformance
  with the amended spec 03 `## Round limits` FAIL-only counting rule (FAIL
  increments / PASS-resolving-a-FAIL shares the number / first review is round 0 /
  one counter per artifact across both phases); point to spec 03 as the single
  source, no divergent restatement (M4 escalation thread, Cycle 2; landed f161fa0).
- [archive/shell-gate-plan.md](archive/shell-gate-plan.md) — `Archived` —
  first learned gate: committed 28-case bats suite for git-identity-guard.sh +
  `gates/shell.md` (Status: Verified, mirrors rust.md) + root CLAUDE.md Shell gate
  section; ran the gate-learning mechanism end-to-end green on loom's own hook
  (M4 dogfooding; deferred-from-M2; gate green 28/28; landed 34de27c).
- [archive/parallelism-behavior-body.md](archive/parallelism-behavior-body.md) — `Archived` —
  M3 parallelism behavior body: new `references/parallelism.md` operationalizing
  ADR 0008 (worktree-per-slice create→work→land→cleanup, the `.docs/` coordination
  model, concurrency safety, slicer-independence rule); repoints the
  `orchestration.md` + `run.md` guards (drops "M3, not yet" / absolute "one slice
  in flight"); adds it to `SKILL.md` + root `CLAUDE.md` (M3 in progress; landed c6ec48e).
- [archive/gate-learning.md](archive/gate-learning.md) — `Archived` —
  gate-learning for unknown stacks: new `references/gate-learning.md` defining the
  inspect → propose → owner-confirm → run-green-once → record `gates/<stack>.md` +
  project `CLAUDE.md` lifecycle (UNVERIFIED until green); repoints the
  Greenfield/Unaligned/Initialized forward pointers at it (last M2 behavior;
  `gates/shell.md` deferred; completes M2 — landed b2463c4).
- [archive/initialized-init-behavior.md](archive/initialized-init-behavior.md) — `Archived` —
  Initialized init behavior body: resume from a state-derived menu (mapped to the
  dispatch table) into scope/gates + the driver loop, plus idempotent playbook
  re-application (final M2 per-mode body; per-mode trio complete; landed b0bd3e9).
- [archive/unaligned-init-behavior.md](archive/unaligned-init-behavior.md) — `Archived` —
  Unaligned init behavior body: alignment pass on an existing project — study the
  repo, reuse Greenfield scaffold + gate, descriptive `spec/` back-fill (no
  decisions), seed `status/`, resume as Initialized (third M2 slice; landed e83e219).
- [archive/author-identity-enforcement-guard.md](archive/author-identity-enforcement-guard.md) — `Archived` —
  author-identity enforcement guard: PreToolUse hook (`plugins/loom/hooks/`) +
  `commit-convention.md` hardening; enforces ADR 0003's uniform commit identity
  (landed a47bf95).
- [archive/init-mode-detection.md](archive/init-mode-detection.md) — `Archived` —
  one authoritative, precise init-mode classifier (first M2 slice; landed 5fef2ed).
- [archive/greenfield-init-behavior.md](archive/greenfield-init-behavior.md) — `Archived` —
  Greenfield init behavior body: scaffold `.docs/`, seed `status/`, write project
  `CLAUDE.md`, establish the gate (second M2 slice; landed a58ff7e).
- [archive/retire-code-review-status-token.md](archive/retire-code-review-status-token.md) — `Archived` —
  retired the obsolete `Code Review` status token from `SKILL.md`, `status-machine.md`,
  `developer.md`, and the slice-plans README `Lifecycle:` string; aligned to spec 03
  (landed a85885f).
- [archive/recommended-tooling-and-mechanical-checks.md](archive/recommended-tooling-and-mechanical-checks.md) — `Archived` —
  recommended CLI/LSP toolkit reference (`references/tooling.md`) + mechanical-invariant-check
  rule in both eval rubrics + cross-links in `SKILL.md` and three agent files;
  addresses eval-miss root cause (eyeballing invariants) (landed db39d44).
- [archive/scope-identity-guard-to-commit-subcommands.md](archive/scope-identity-guard-to-commit-subcommands.md) — `Abandoned` —
  reverted — shell-string carve-out leaked overrides; read-filter false-positive
  accepted as documented limitation (commit-convention.md).
